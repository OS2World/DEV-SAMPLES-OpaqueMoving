This is a program I wrote to explore the possibilities of
Opaque window moves. It allows the user to move the
window by it's title bar, without the wire frame. It moves
the actual window with the mouse.

One other interesting idea is that the window doesn't pop
up to the foreground when moved. This allows the window
to be moved without changing it's "z-order". The window does
pop up with just a click on it.

The program is available with source code. enhframe.c and
enhframe.h can be incorporated into any program. So if you
are a programmer you can take these files and add them to
your project. A simple call to EnhanceFrame(hwndFrame);
will make your frame OpaqueMovable.

The enhwin.exe is a compilation of enhwin.c that uses enhframe
module to enhance it's frame.

enhframe.mak is a makefile for BC OS/2. If anyone can write me
a tested make file for any other compiler, please send it to me.
I would apperciate that. If you unzipped it using unzip.exe
shareware utility, EA's of the files should have been extracted.
The make file has a "Make Me" menu added on. Select it if you
use BC OS/2.
